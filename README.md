# Exercise-2
Submission for Exercise 2

This code takes the path of the directory containing either the H2O or H2S outfiles (not both) as an input
and outputs 1) a potential energy surface and 2) frequencies for the bend and symmetric stretch normal modes.
User input of path can be done by pasting path and replacing backslashes by forward slashes.
This programme requires os, numpy and matplotlib packages to be installed.
